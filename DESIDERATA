A list of things we might want to add in future:

- Polar ice caps (including waxing/waning).
- Shelf/land areas for continents (concentric circles).
- Both of the above could be attached to a sea-level function.
- Magic portal for sweepstakes dispersal.
- Mountain ranges (additional dispersal barrier) where continents collide.
- Climactic bands (and association for taxa) that also limit dispersal.
- Measure continental/land/shelf area and have as extra output.
- Use function to test existing biogeographic methods.
- Slow speed of continents once they are touching.
- Make a nice plotting function.
- Standardise function inputs.
- Ensure all functions are verbose (x = y, not just y).
- Species-area effect on b and d.
- Check clade start point not biased towards continent centre.
- Get actual data out (inputs to get distance matrices and perform Mantel tests).
- Make tree ladderizable and have long-lat matrix match tree$edge.
- Need to solve inheritance problem so clades/continents/latitudinal bands etc. can have separate b, d, step sd etc.

Already added:

- Dispersals can be biased by direction (e.g., E-W easier than N-S).
