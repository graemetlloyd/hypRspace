A list of things we might want to add in future:

- Polar ice caps (including waxing/waning).
- Shelf/land areas for continents (concentric circles).
- Both of the above could be attached to a sea-level function.
- Magic portal for sweepstakes dispersal.
- Mountain ranges (additional dispersal barrier) where continents collide.
- Climactic bands (and association for taxa) that also limit dispersal.
- Measure continental/land/shelf area and have as extra output.
- Use function to test existing biogeographic methods.
- Slow speed of continents once they are touching.
- Make a nice plotting function.
- Standardise function inputs.
- Ensure all functions are verbose (x = y, not just y).
- Species-area effect on b and d.
- Get actual data out (inputs to get distance matrices and perform Mantel tests).
- Make tree ladderizable and have long-lat matrix match tree$edge.
- Need to solve inheritance problem so clades/continents/latitudinal bands etc. can have separate b, d, step sd etc.
- Think about adjust probabilitites for actual time intended to represent! E.g., b and d may need to be lower due to extra animal loops. And more generally actual time should perhaps be a consideration as relativity could make it confusing for the user.
- Standardise language regarding continental units (individual continents and clumps).
- Remove geiger dependency if possible.
- Make function restart if complete extinction happens before end of time window.
- Check EarthRad propagates correctly through all functions and subfunctions.
- Add option to turn animals off (and just simulate continents).
- Start point still biased as areas of overlap in supercontinent are more likely start spots!

Already added:

- Dispersals can be biased by direction (e.g., E-W easier than N-S).
- Allow continents to move clockwise or anticlockwise (this is allowed in practice as Euler poles can be on either side of the planet).
- Fixed bias in clade start point.
